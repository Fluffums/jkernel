To install: place the files in ~/.ipython/kernels/jkernel directory. Open `ipython notebook` from that directory.

Install pexpect module for Python.

Requires IPython 3.0+.

(jkernel.py should be placed in Python's `dist-packages` directory to be accessible from everywhere, but that's not necessary yet)

Won't work on Windows because of pexpect.

Not sure if will work in Python2, tested on Py3 only.
