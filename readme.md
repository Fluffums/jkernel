To install: place the files in ~/.ipython/kernels/jkernel directory. Make sure that the path to jconsole in the script is okay. Open `ipython notebook` from this directory.

Requires IPython 3.0+.

(jkernel.py should be placed in Python's `dist-packages` directory to be accessible from everywhere, but that's not important at this stage)

Not sure if will work in Python2, tested on Py3 only.
